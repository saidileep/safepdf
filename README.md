SafePDF is a Streamlit web app that lets you upload a locked PDF, enter its password, and instantly download an un-encrypted copy.

## ðŸ—‚ Project structure

```
safe_pdf_app/
â”œâ”€â”€ streamlit_app.py   # Main Streamlit UI (auto-run on Streamlit Cloud)

## ðŸš€ Deploy on Streamlit Community Cloud

1. Push the `safe_pdf_app` folder to a public GitHub repository **or** create a new repo containing only these files.
2. Sign in to [streamlit.io/cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) and click **"New app"**.
3. Select your repository and branch, and set **`streamlit_app.py`** as the main file (default value).
4. Click **"Deploy"** â€“ Streamlit Cloud will install the packages in `requirements.txt` and launch your app.

That's it! Share the generated URL with anyone who needs to unlock PDFs securely.
